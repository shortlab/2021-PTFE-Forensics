Figure Notes - FDSC heating rate

Heating Rates tested on an practice microtome section slice
Order of cycles:
1-2: 500 kps
3-4: 200 kps
5-6: 100 kps 
7-8: 50 kps
9-10: 10 kps
11: 1 kps
12-15: 500 kps

Figure generated in processHR.m
Note that the data for different heating rates was different because the automatic sampling rate would change by order of magnitude
For comparison purposes, data was interpolated at the lowest number of points
Spline baseline was subtracted.

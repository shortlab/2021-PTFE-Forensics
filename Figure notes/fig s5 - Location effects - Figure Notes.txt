Figure Notes - Location study explanation and result
-Heating rate: 10 C/min

(a) - Sample locations
-raw image, no corrections
-annotated in Illustrator
---box to mark film itself
---approximate scale bar based on 1/4" graph paper
---skived direction


(b) - Data colored by Column
-Recrystallization data (cool2) from location study
---Interpolated during data loading
---Spline baseline subtracted
-------Spline Parameters--------
-----Cooling: range = 20 C left of peak to 15 C right of peak (assuming 60 pts/C), linear construction lines from one half (1/f, f=2) of each side.

(c+d) - Peak area color map - Location Study
-Recrystallization (cool2) and melting (heat2) data from location study
---Interpolated during data loading
---Spline baseline subtracted (Cool2_loc_adj.m and Heat2_loc_adj.m)
-------Spline Parameters--------
-----Cooling: range = 20 C left of peak to 15 C right of peak (assuming 60 pts/C), linear construction lines from one half (1/f, f=2) of each side.
-----Heating: range = 30 C left of peak to 15 C right of peak (assuming 60 pts/C), linear construction lines from one half (1/f, f=2) of each side.
---Enthalpy is the integration of baseline-corrected data, divided by the heating rate
-Data plotted is the linear interpolation of the heat and cool data as contour-style plots, with the script generated by cftool
-Figures generated using Plot_loc.m	
---Plot_loc.m cleaned up to only produce desired figures 3/30/21
-Full window for proportions


(e+f) - Peak area color map - Main study, control samples
-Actual control peak area data from main study, saved as heatIntegrals.mat and coolIntegrals.mat, and then divided by heating rate for units of enthalpy
-Data plotted is the linear interpolation of the heat and cool data as contour-style plots, with the script generated by cftool

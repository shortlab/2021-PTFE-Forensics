Figure Notes - DSC and FDSC data processing/spline baseline definitions figure.
-Demonstrating and comparing baseline construction for FDSC and DSC 


(a) and (b): DSC - Heat and Cool data (2nd cycle)
Figures created in Cool2_Apr19_finalAnalysis.m and Heat2_apr19_finalAnalysis.m
Actual data, control sample number 2
Cool: interpolated, centered around peak, 20 C left + 15 C right of peak, f = 2 (fraction of range to either side used for definition of construction lines)
Heat: interpolated, centered around peak, 30 C left + 15 C right of peak, f = 2 (fraction of range to either side used for definition of construction lines)

(c): Explanation for why spline (vs linear baseline)
Figure created in Heat2_Apr19_figs.m, for heating data
Compares std/area (relative deviation) for linear and spline baselines
Linear baseline defined as straight line between 260 and 360 C
Spline baseline NOT centered around peak, construction lines defined [295,310] and [340,355]

(d): FDSC  - Cool data (just baseline construction explanation)
Raw data loaded individually with loading scripts and saved to .mat files
Construction lines are NOT centered around peak. Simply defined from [220,260] and [350,365] C.
Figure generated with FinalAnalysis.m and %%figure section commented in for the Spline_Baseline_Integral.m function 
Data from Class 4 slice 23 (set _76) and slice 32 (set _77) in blue and cyan
